these are the scripts that can be used to make life even easier
- createnote.sh: you can run this to create a new blog and when you quit the editor it automatically uploads the file by simply pushing to github. there a wokflow takes over.
- installnote.sh: when you run this it takes in a path tho the actual location that the create note is targeting and adds createnote.sh as createnote to the path
