in most cases you probably mean to set an apex domain to be the one that presents the github page.

the apex domain is just literally your subdomain.domain.topleveldomain without the subdomain part.

i.e. justthoughts.xyz in my case

to do that you need to configure the dns settings.

i am using namecheap so i have to add the following:

1. as of today you can use this url template and replace the domain with yours:
  -> https://ap.www.namecheap.com/Domains/DomainControlPanel/YOURDOMAIN.TLD/advancedns 
  -> remember the ".tld" is just the .com or .xyz or .io, aka top level domain
2. then just delete all dns settings in the host records section. we will learn it from the ground up
  -> now we need to add new records and you can find even more information directly at the [github documentation on configuring the records](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site#dns-records-for-your-custom-domain)
so to keep it short just create new records with the following content:

| Record Type  | Domain | IP Address          | Settings  |
|--------------|--------|---------------------|-----------|
| A Record     | @      | 185.199.108.153     | Automatic |
| A Record     | @      | 185.199.111.153     | Automatic |
| A Record     | @      | 185.199.109.153     | Automatic |
| A Record     | @      | 185.199.110.153     | Automatic |
| CNAME Record | *      | m-c-frank.github.io | Automatic |


then in the github project you have to manually enter the domain name you want to use

and i would suggest setting the enforce https option

## new things to do now:
- learn about dns and how to test this
- write the script that does this setup automatically
- learn more about the `dig` command
- verifying custom domain for github pages -> MOST IMPORTANT TO MAKE LIFE EASY
