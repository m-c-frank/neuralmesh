if you intend to deploy the github page on the apex domain then you dont have to change the baseurl to anything

just leave it at "/" instead of "/justthoughts/" in my case. you can look at issue #7 or the connected pull request

now i will revert the pr and change it back to just "/" but this was a nice learning expericenec!
